Submission Overview:

To approach the task of developing a universal algorithm for time series data analysis, I would follow a structured framework that incorporates various stages of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and result analysis. Here's an outline of the process:

1. **Preliminary Data Examination:**
   - Begin by visually inspecting the time series data to understand its general characteristics and trends.
   - Conduct basic summary statistics to identify any initial outliers or unusual patterns.
   - Apply a unit root test, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, to assess stationarity. Non-stationarity may require differencing.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Normalize or standardize the data as needed to ensure consistency in feature scales.
   - Handle missing values through interpolation or imputation methods.
   - Consider detrending or deseasonalizing if cyclical components are evident.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Explore feature transformations, such as logarithmic or exponential adjustments, to stabilize variance if necessary.
   - Assess the correlation among features and perform dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain essential information.
   - Evaluate causality between features, using Granger causality tests or other time series causality methods.

4. **Feature Selection:**
   - Select a subset of features based on their statistical significance and relevance to the output variable. Features that contribute little may be excluded.
   - Consider recursive feature elimination or feature importance techniques from machine learning models.

5. **Model Selection:**
   - Based on the nature of the data (e.g., trend, seasonality, and cyclicity), choose an appropriate modeling approach.
   - For basic time series data, consider using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models or seasonal decomposition methods.
   - Explore more advanced techniques like Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or Prophet to capture cyclical patterns.
   - Evaluate machine learning models like Gradient Boosting or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for complex time series with intricate dependencies.
   
6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
   - Employ cross-validation to validate the model's performance on different subsets of the data and check for overfitting.
   - Test the model's statistical significance, e.g., by conducting hypothesis tests on coefficients or model predictions.

7. **Cyclicity Considerations:**
   - If cyclical patterns are detected in the data (weekly, monthly, etc.), disintegrate the data into trend and cyclical components.
   - Utilize libraries like Prophet to extract cyclic information.
   - Determine the threshold for switching from standard prediction to cyclicity-based prediction, guided by model performance and domain knowledge.

This framework is a guideline for the time series analysis process. The specific steps and techniques employed may vary based on the unique characteristics of the data. Creativity in adapting and modifying the approach to best suit the data's nature and the incorporation of additional elements, like cyclicity analysis, is crucial to developing an innovative and effective framework for time series data analysis.

I'll submit my framework by the specified deadline. Thank you for considering my approach.

### Depth estimation in monocular images


This repository contains code and models for our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13413):


### Setup 

1) Download the model weights and place them in the `weights` folder:


Monodepth:
- [dpt_hybrid-midas-501f0c75.pt](https://github.com/intel-isl/DPT/releases/download/1_0/dpt_hybrid-midas-501f0c75.pt), [Mirror](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dgcJEYYw1F8qirXhZxgNK8dWWz_8gZBD/view?usp=sharing)
- [dpt_large-midas-2f21e586.pt](https://github.com/intel-isl/DPT/releases/download/1_0/dpt_large-midas-2f21e586.pt), [Mirror](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vnuhoMc6caF-buQQ4hK0CeiMk9SjwB-G/view?usp=sharing)
2) Set up dependencies: 

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   The code was tested with Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.8.0, OpenCV 4.5.1, and timm 0.4.5

### Usage 

1) Place one or more input images in the folder `input`.

2) Run a monocular depth estimation model:

    ```shell
    python run_monodepth.py
    ```

3) The results are written to the folder `output_monodepth`.

Use the flag `-t` to switch between different models. Possible options are `dpt_hybrid` (default) and `dpt_large`.


**Additional models:**
